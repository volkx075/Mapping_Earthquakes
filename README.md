# Mapping Earthquakes
## Purpose
Basil and Sadhana likes how I created two maps and the earthquake overlay for my earthquake map. They would like me to create a map that shows the earthquake data along with the tetonic plates' location on earth. Also, Basil and Sadhana would like for me to add an overlay of earthquakes with greater than 4.5 magnitude on the map. Lastly, they want me to add a dark map option as a third map option.
